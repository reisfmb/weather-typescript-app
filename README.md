# Tasks

:white_check_mark: Create a weather widget/page using Typescript + HTML/CSS (or Bootstrap) 

**Decided to go with raw Scss using the BEM pattern**.


:white_check_mark: Should display the weather in Oslo and SÃ£o Paulo using http://openweathermap.org/API services

**Done :)**


:white_check_mark: The widget/page should update periodically 

**Caches data from the API in localStorage for 1 minute and updates if there is a change in the temperature of +-1 Kelvin**.


:white_check_mark: Html design skills. How the tags are used and what tags are used. CSS styling (or usage of ready UI bootstrap frameworks). Experience with Typescript. Clean code. Testability.

**Did my best and also implemented unit tests for each .tsx component**


# How to run

In the project directory, simply run `yarn start`. 

To run the unit tests for each .tsx component, simply run `yarn test` in the project directory.
